Hi, I'm Caesar. 

I'm a software engineer from Indonesia, currently based in Tokyo, Japan.

I dedicate most of my time to the world of Software Engineering / Computer Science.

In a gist, I'm a pragmatic engineer. I do not believe there is one single best tool for a job.

That being said, I've been primarily working with C++, Go, and Python lately.

If you'd like to connect with me, feel free to drop a message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/caesarstefanus)
